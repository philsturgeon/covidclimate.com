<h1>COVID vs Climate</h1>

<p class="intro">
  As the world focuses on tackling COVID-19, we must not forget: this won‚Äôt be
  the last pandemic we suffer.
</p>

<section id="reasons">
  <p>
    Climate change is bringing about health problems and economic instability,
    caused by extreme weather events, droughts, floods ‚Äì exacerbating
    air pollution, the spread of bugs and water-borne bacteria, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hard won environmental legislation being tossed in the bin daily with the
    stroke of a pen. Charities and groups who were already battling against the
    odds to secure our future, but now they're fighting on considerably more
    fronts with decreased funding as people struggle to afford food let alone charity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lockdowns worldwide might have stalled a few greenhouse gas emission charts,
    but any short term gains are being massively outweighed by long term impacts
    created by lobbyists and supported by ignorant government officials. Despite
    all this, some people think that Mother Earth is somehow "doing well" out of
    this, some going as far as saying this is the world environmental activists
    have been hoping for. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let's look into events that have positively or negatively impacted the
    environment.
  </p>
