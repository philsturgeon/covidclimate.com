  url: "https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/national-forest-logging-extended-to-support-industry-in-pandemic"
  about: >
    The Trump administration is allowing loggers to extend timber harvesting
    contracts by up to two years for contracts issued prior to April 1 in
    national forests in the Lower 48 states. Loggers in Alaska’s Tongass
    National Forest, who have seen their market “exceptionally disrupted,” can
    have their contracts extended for three years. Seen by many as a back-door
    approach to prop up an industry hurt by a trade war with China started by
    President Donald Trump.

    commerce, but demand is down about 35 percent. While significant, the cuts
    agreed to on Sunday still fall far short of what is needed to bring oil
    production in line with demand.

    Because there are so few cars on the road, few factories belching out black

    At night there are stars. During the day the air is so clean that, for once,
    you can’t taste it, free of the usual smoky metallic tang. One cruelty of the

    ordered to stay indoors unless vitally necessary, only to look out your windows
    and see this.
