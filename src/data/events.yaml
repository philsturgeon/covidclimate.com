  about: > 
    The American Petroleum Institute got the Environmental Protection Agency to
    stop enforcing environmental and public health protections indefinitely,
    telling companies they would not need to meet environmental standards during
    the coronavirus outbreak.

    number of industries to skirt environmental laws, with the agency saying it
    will not “seek penalties for noncompliance with routine monitoring and
    reporting obligations.”

    on policy decisions — from public comment periods to oil and gas lease sales
